question: Your Results
subquestion: |
  Thank you for using this demonstration of the use of Blawx and it's Docassemble integration
  for Rules as Code.

  %for k,v in answer['answers'].items():
  ## ${ value(value(v['instanceName'])) }
  ${ value(value(v['instanceName'])) }
  %if v['entitled_to_testing'] == 'true':
  is
  %else:
  is not
  %endif
  entitled to Covid-19 testing.
  
  ${ value(value(v['instanceName'])) }
  %if v['required_to_isolate_10'] == 'true':
  is
  %else:
  is not
  %endif
  required to isolate for 10 days, or until symptoms resolve, whichever is sooner.
  
  ${ value(value(v['instanceName'])) }
  %if v['required_to_isolate_14'] == 'true':
  is
  %else:
  is not
  %endif
  required to isolate for 14 days.

question: Do you want to tell me about another person?
subquestion: |
  You can have this system determine the isolation requirements and testing entitlements
  for multiple poeple at the same time. In order to advise accurately, you must also
  provide information about the following categories of people if they have tested
  positive for corona virus:
  
  * people with whom they live
  * people to whom they provide care
  * people with whom they are in close contact
  * people whose bodily fluids they have direct exposure to
  
  The system will ask you about all of the people individualy, and then will ask about
  the relationships between the people.
  
  Do you want to provide information about another person?
yesno: person.there_is_another

question: Covid-19 Rules as Code Demonstration for MIT Computational Law Report
subquestion: |
  This interview is a demonstration of Rules as Code powered web applications
  developed for a paper about [Blawx.com](https://www.blawx.com) in the
  [MIT Computational Law Report](https://law.mit.edu).
  
  The source code for the encoding of the Covid-19 rules used in this application
  is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Blawx/mit-paper).
  
  Information about the Rules as Code development tool Blawx is avaialble at the
  [Blawx website](https://www.blawx.com).
  The Blawx software is open source and
  [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Blawx/blawx).
  
  This interview is developed in Docassemble, using docassemble-blawx, a module
  to allow you to use Blawx encodings to answer legal questions inside a
  docassemble interview. Docassemble-blawx is also
  [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Blawx/docassemble-blawx).
  
  This tool was developed using an encoding of the Covid-19 testing eligibility
  and isolation requirements in the Province of Alberta in May of 2020. **It is
  out of date, and should not be relied upon for any real-world purpose.**
fields:
  - I acknowledge that this tool is not for real-world use: intro
    datatype: yesnowide

  if not intro:
    validation_error("You may not proceed without acknowledging.")
